# film-roulette

A web application to discover films.

The inspiration to build this project stemmed from too much time spent mulling over what film I wanted to watch. In need of a tool to help me decide, I created Film Roulette! It includes a form to help filter search results, delivers all necessary information about each film as well as a link to view the trailer, and a personal watchlist!

Within building Film Roulette, I employed tools such as...  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__AJAX__ to request data from a [public film __API__](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__Local Storage__ and __JSON__ to serialize/deserialize a data model for the watchlist.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__Mobile-First Design__ through execution of __media-queries__, __Flexbox__, and __CSS Grid Layout__.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__SPA__(Single-page application) by incorporating data views.
